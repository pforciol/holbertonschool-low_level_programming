# 0x0A - C - argc, argv

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* How to use arguments passed to your program
* What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
* How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters
