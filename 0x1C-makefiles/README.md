# 0x1C - C - Makefiles

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What are `make`, Makefiles
* When, why and how to use Makefiles
* What are rules and how to set and use them
* What are explicit and implicit rules
* What are the most common / useful rules
* What are variables and how to set and use them
