# 0x07 - C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What are pointers to pointers and how to use them
* What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
* What are the most common C standard library functions to manipulate strings
