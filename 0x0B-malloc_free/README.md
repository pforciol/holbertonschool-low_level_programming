# 0x0B - C - malloc, free

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
* What is `malloc` and `free` and how to use them
* Why and when use `malloc`
* How to use `valgrind` to check for memory leak
